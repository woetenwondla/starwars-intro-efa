                <p class="text-center">The european union is shook by several crisis,
                    from corona to a currently ongoing war.
                    No end is so far in sight and there is even a bigger crisis on the horizon,
                    the climate crisis. Humans have long evaded clear actions to keep the
                    global warming low. Currently global warming is at 1.2 °C and seems to rise up to 3.2°C
                    until the mid of the century. This would result in catastrophic heat waves, floods and droughts
                    killing 100 millions of peoples. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-center">
                    Therefore drastic measures have to be taken now.
                    Still many governments try to flee their responsibility to take actions.
                    Almost anywhere people rise up to make their governments do the necessary stuff.
                    Jan Aigner fights with his fellow activists from FFF for a peaceful future.
                    Although there were some successes during the last months,
                    it does not seem to be enough to really make a lasting change.
                    Therefore he is trying to shape his profession to make an impact,
                    by developing a platform which should help people connect and take collective action.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-center">
                    He is still at the very start of his journey, but he seeks to build the skills and community
                    to make this vision reality. Not long ago, he stumbled across this European Forum Alpbach
                    and realized this might be a chance to make a warp jump on his way. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-center">
                    So, Jan Aigner set his next waypoint to Alpbach, in the hope,
                    to meet the right people and get the knowledge to step him one level up.
                    Let's see what adventures await him...
